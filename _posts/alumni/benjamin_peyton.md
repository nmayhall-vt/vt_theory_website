My research focuses on developing model chemistries for reducing computational cost or solving unique problems in electronic structure theory-- these include model reactions, fragmentation schemes, and machine-learning algorithms. My previous work has involved using model reactions and many-body expansions to divide large molecular systems into smaller fragments for calculating strain energetics or solvated response properties. I am currently developing machine-learning algorithms for compact wavefunction design. Stop by my <a href="{{ page.github_url }}">Github</a> to learn more!
