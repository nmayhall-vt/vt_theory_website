## Current Projects

**Machine Learning of Electronic Pair Correlation Function**

- Currently working on decribing the correlation between electrons in real space orbitials. Later use this data to construct a function that does not need T2 connected amplitudes.

**UCCF12 Hamiltonian Correction to Improve Performance of Small Basis Sets**

- using a similarity transformed hamiltonian which corrects for cusp conditions, in order to see if the correction improves accuracy even at small basis sets. I run calculations on various molecules to see how this method behaves. .
